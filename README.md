# corr_GPU
A simple, fast, standalone nvidia GPU-based FX correlator suitable streamed data applications.

The code is based on [Wayth et al, 2009 - "A GPU-based Real-time Software Correlation System for the Murchison Widefield Array Prototype"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PASP..121..857W/abstract), and has been tweaked over time to cater for many different input data types.

The code is based on CUDA and requires a CUDA capapble GPU.

### Dependencies
